SNHU Computer Science 210
This is the work from my course at SNHU using C++
This project was created to display the time and allow the user to add one hour, one minute, or one second to the clock. 
I enjoyed this project, because I found it challenging. I could enhance my code by structuring the user interface to be more user friendly. 
I found the getting 24 hour aspect the most difficult. This can be adapted to be more efficient, but creating a little clock was a helpful tool to carry with me.
